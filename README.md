## Special Notes

-All data saves and loads automatically. Be sure to have the binary and image files all located within the same folder so the  runnable .jar file. This ensures all of the data will be read by the application.

-The employee ID to log in is "E1" ans the password is "habitat12". New employees are required to change it as soon as possible. This account is for an Administrator, whom has unrestricted access to all of the application's features.

-Other features include: picking, packing and shipping functionality.
